#  WTF is Gnars? 

Gnars DAO is a permissionless, open-source community and action sports accelerator created to support athletes, creators, and enthusiasts by helping them gain visibility and get rewarded for their contributions to extreme sports culture. Operating as a community-owned brand, Gnars uses a decentralized governance system where members propose and vote on initiatives to fund — from public goods like skatepark refurbishments to creative projects such as film production and community events. 

By leveraging platforms like [Flows](https://flows.wtf/gnars), [Zora](https://zora.co/@gnarscommunity) , [ThatsGnarly](https://thatsgnarly.com) — where creators can upload content, mint work, earn rewards, and onboard seamlessly. Gnars brings athletes “onchain” and enables them to turn their passion into sustainable growth without relying on traditional sponsorships. With a focus on inclusivity and collaboration, Gnars fosters a space where anyone can contribute to shaping its future, making it a unique, community-driven brand that prioritizes the growth of action sports and creator-led projects. An OG DAO, founded on Ethereum Mainnet, now operating in the Base ecosystem as a Nouns subDAO. ⌐◨-◨
